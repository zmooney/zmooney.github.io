    Headlined by star defenseman - Victor Hedman - the Tampa Bay Lightning are sitting in 2nd place in the Atlantic Division with 66 points. Their strong play on the defensive end has helped the offense generate some goals on the other end. As we enter the 2nd half of the season, the Lightning are looking to make another deep playoff run as they seek their 3rd straight Stanley Cup.
