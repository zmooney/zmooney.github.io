    Headlined by star defenseman - Victor Hedman - the Tampa Bay Lightning are sitting in 2nd place in the Atlantic Division with 66 points. Their strong play on the defensive end has helped the offense generate some goals on the other end. Steven Stamkos is having a breakout year in his 13th professional season. Being able to stay healthy has helped him put the Lightning in this position. They have had a strong start to their season and at the All-Star break, they have set themselves up well. As we enter the 2nd half of the season, the Lightning are looking to make another deep playoff run as they seek their 3rd straight Stanley Cup. The Lightning kick off the 2nd half of the season on the road in Colorado in the NHL 2022 Stadium Series.
